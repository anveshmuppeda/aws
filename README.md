## Overview

This repository is curated to provide a comprehensive collection of hands-on labs for a diverse set of AWS services. Our goal is to support learners, cloud architects, developers, and DevOps engineers by offering practical examples and detailed guides that help you build proficiency in:
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Dive into AWS CDK, cdk8s, and CloudFormation to learn how to design and deploy robust cloud architectures.
- **Service-Specific Labs:** From basic VPC and EC2 examples to advanced use cases such as Lambda functions, API Gateways, S3 Buckets, and beyond.
- **Step-by-Step Guides:** Each lab includes well-commented code, clear instructions, and an explanation of best practices to help you understand the underlying AWS services.
- **Hands-On Learning:** Experiment with our templates and guides to quickly set up, deploy, and validate your own cloud solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured to ensure ease of navigation. Here is an overview of the main directories:

```

Each main folder is self-contained, with a `README.md` that offers context, instructions, and references to the relevant steps.

## Key Components

### AWS CDK

- **What it is:** AWS CDK allows you to define cloud infrastructure in your favorite programming language and deploy it through AWS CloudFormation.
- **What Youâ€™ll Find:** Multiple labs under `cdk` that showcase best practices for using AWS CDKâ€”ranging from basic stack creation to constructing multi-tier architectures.
- **Learn More:** Each CDK lab provides a detailed guide on setting up, running, and testing your deployments.

### cdk8s

- **What it is:** cdk8s is an open-source framework that enables you to define Kubernetes applications and generate standard YAML manifests using familiar programming languages.
- **What Youâ€™ll Find:** Under the `cdk8s` folder, you will see sample applications demonstrating how to create and manage Kubernetes resources programmatically.
- **Learn More:** Each lab contains instructions and code samples that walk you through the process of container orchestration and deployment.

### CloudFormation Templates and Guides

- **What they are:** CloudFormation provides a proven way to model and provision AWS infrastructure using declarative templates.
- **What Youâ€™ll Find:** The `cloudformationtemplates` folder contains a comprehensive collection of templates, from simple networking stacks to complex multi-service deployments. These templates are complemented by step-by-step guides.
- **Learn More:** Our documentation includes usage instructions, parameter explanations, and best practices for organizing and deploying CloudFormation stacks.

### Additional Services and Projects

- **Projects Folder:** Explore sample projects that integrate various AWS services. Whether you prefer Node.js, Python, or serverless architectures, you will find hands-on samples that demonstrate real-world scenarios.
- **Documentation and Classes:** The `docs` folder includes additional resources such as class slides, diagrams, and diagrams to supplement your learning.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the Directory:** Start by navigating to the directory that matches your interest (e.g., CDK labs, CloudFormation templates).
2. **Follow the Guides:** Each sub-folder comes with its own README that provides the context, prerequisites, and step-by-step instructions.
3. **Run the Code:** Clone the repository, set up your environment as per the guide, and run the sample labs.
4. **Experiment and Expand:** Use these examples as a foundation to experiment with your own AWS services and configurations. Feedback and improvements are always welcome!
