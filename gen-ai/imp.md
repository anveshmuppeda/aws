Exam Alert:

Note the following regarding the techniques to improve the performance of a Foundation Model (FM):

Prompt engineering does NOT change the weights of the FM. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) does NOT change the weights of the FM. Fine-tuning DOES change the weights of the FM.

The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for tuning hyperparameters and selecting the best model during the training process, and the test set is used for evaluating the final performance of the model on unseen data.








multimodal model:
A multimodal model is an artificial intelligence system designed to process and understand multiple types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video. Unlike unimodal models, which handle a single type of data, multimodal models can integrate and make sense of information from various sources, allowing them to perform more complex and versatile tasks.
Multimodal models represent a significant advancement in AI, enabling the integration and understanding of multiple types of data. By combining different modalities, these models can perform a wide range of complex tasks, making them highly versatile and powerful tools in various fields.

multi-modal embedding model:
A multi-modal embedding model is the most suitable choice for this task because it enables the integration of multiple types of data, such as text and images, into a unified representation. This allows the chatbot to effectively process and understand queries containing both text and visual content by aligning them in a shared embedding space, facilitating more accurate and context-aware responses.
You can generate embeddings for your content and store them in a vector database. When an end user submits any combination of text and image as a search query, the model generates embeddings for the search query and matches them to the stored embeddings to provide relevant search and recommendations results to end users. For example, a stock photography company with hundreds of millions of images can use the model to power its search functionality, so users can search for images using a phrase, image, or a combination of image and text. You can further customize the model to enhance its understanding of your unique content and provide more meaningful results using image-text pairs for fine-tuning.

multi-modal generative model:
multi-modal generative model can generate outputs based on multiple types of input data, it is more complex and typically used for generating new content rather than interpreting and responding to queries. In addition, it is costlier to build and maintain a multi-modal generative model compared to a multi-modal embedding model. A multi-modal embedding model is more efficient for understanding and processing combined text and image inputs, whereas a generative model may be excessive if the primary goal is to process and respond to existing multi-modal queries.

A text-only language model
- A text-only language model cannot handle image data because it is designed to process and generate text exclusively. This model lacks the capability to understand or incorporate visual information, making it unsuitable for a chatbot that needs to interpret both text and images in user queries.

convolutional neural network (CNN):
 A convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed specifically for image recognition and processing tasks and is highly effective for analyzing visual data. However, it cannot process text-based inputs and therefore cannot fulfill the requirement of handling multi-modal queries that include both text and images. A CNN would need to be combined with other models to process text, which adds complexity without directly addressing the multi-modal nature of the queries.



Asynchronous inference
Asynchronous inference is the most suitable choice for this scenario. It allows the company to process smaller payloads without requiring real-time responses by queuing the requests and handling them in the background. This method is cost-effective and efficient when some delay is acceptable, as it frees up resources and optimizes compute usage. Asynchronous inference is ideal for scenarios where the payload size is less than 1 GB and immediate results are not critical.

Batch inference - Batch inference is generally used for processing large datasets all at once. While it does not require immediate responses, it is typically more efficient for handling larger payloads (several gigabytes or more). For smaller payloads of less than 1 GB, batch inference might be overkill and less cost-efficient compared to asynchronous inference.

Real-time inference - Real-time inference is optimized for scenarios where low latency is essential, and responses are needed immediately. It is not suitable for cases where the system can afford to wait for responses, as it might lead to higher costs and resource consumption without providing any additional benefit for this particular use case.

Serverless inference - Serverless inference is a good choice for workloads with unpredictable traffic or sporadic requests, as it scales automatically based on demand. However, it may not be as cost-effective for scenarios where workloads are predictable, and some waiting time is acceptable. Asynchronous inference provides a more targeted solution for handling delayed responses at a lower cost.



TOP P
Top P represents the percentage of most likely candidates that the model considers for the next token. Choose a lower value to decrease the size of the pool and limit the options to more likely outputs. Choose a higher value to increase the size of the pool and allow the model to consider less likely outputs

TOP K
The inference parameter Top K represents the number of most likely candidates that the model considers for the next token.

temperature
Use lower temperature if you want more deterministic responses, and use higher temperature if you want creative or different responses for the same prompt on Amazon Bedrock. So, this option is incorrect.

Stop sequence
Stop sequence - Stop sequences specify the sequences of characters that stop the model from generating further tokens. If the model generates a stop sequence that you specify, it will stop generating after that sequence.

Response length
Response length represents the minimum or maximum number of tokens to return in the generated response.




Supervised learning
Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset to predict outcomes based on input features. While effective for tasks like image recognition or language translation.

Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is designed to identify patterns and structures in data without any predefined labels, making it useful for tasks such as clustering or dimensionality reduction.

incremental training
incremental training is useful for updating a model with new data continuously, it focuses on enhancing a single model's performance with its own data rather than learning from the data of other models. This approach is not designed for optimizing multiple models by leveraging knowledge across different use cases, making it less suitable for the company’s objective.

Self-supervised learning
Self-supervised learning is effective for tasks where labeled data is scarce or unavailable, as it allows models to learn useful representations from large amounts of unlabeled data. However, it does not directly address the need to optimize multiple models using the latest data from other models. This approach is more suitable for foundational training rather than model optimization across different use cases.

Semi-supervised learning
Semi-supervised learning is when you apply both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to a common problem. This technique relies on using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to train systems. First, the labeled data is used to partially train the machine learning algorithm. After that, the partially trained algorithm labels the unlabeled data. This process is called pseudo-labeling. The model is then re-trained on the resulting data mix without being explicitly programmed.

Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is designed for scenarios where a model needs to learn a sequence of actions to achieve a specific goal by maximizing cumulative rewards. It is primarily used in decision-making problems, such as game playing or robotic control. It is not well-suited for optimizing multiple models by learning from the latest data of other models, as it does not involve leveraging cross-model data or knowledge sharing.


Feature engineering for structured data typically includes tasks like normalization, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. For unstructured data, such as text or images, feature engineering involves different tasks like tokenization (breaking down text into tokens), vectorization (converting text or images into numerical vectors), and extracting features that can represent the content meaningfully.

Feature Engineering
Feature Engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features from raw data to enhance the performance of machine learning models. It is crucial because it can lead to significant improvements in model accuracy and efficiency by providing the model with better representations of the data.

Hyperparameter tuning:
Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are the external configurations of the model that are set before training and cannot be learned from the data. Feature Engineering is not related to Hyperparameter tuning.
Hyperparameter tuning is the most effective solution in this scenario because it allows the company to adjust the settings that control the learning process of the model. By fine-tuning hyperparameters, such as increasing regularization or early stopping or adjusting dropout rates, the model can avoid overfitting to the training data and better generalize to new, unseen data in production. This approach helps improve the model's performance across various data distributions.





Fraud identification
Within a large set of transactional data, there’s a subset of labeled data where experts have confirmed fraudulent transactions. For a more accurate result, the machine learning solution would train first on the unlabeled data and then with the labeled data.

Sentiment analysis
When considering the breadth of an organization’s text-based customer interactions, it may not be cost-effective to categorize or label sentiment across all channels. An organization could train a model on the larger unlabeled portion of data first, and then a sample that has been labeled. This would provide the organization with a greater degree of confidence in customer sentiment across the business.

Incorrect options:

Neural network - A neural network solution is a more complex supervised learning technique. To produce a given outcome, it takes some given inputs and performs one or more layers of mathematical transformation based on adjusting data weightings. An example of a neural network technique is predicting a digit from a handwritten image.

Clustering - Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups certain data inputs, so they may be categorized as a whole. There are various types of clustering algorithms depending on the input data. An example of clustering is identifying different types of network traffic to predict potential security incidents.

Dimensionality reduction - Dimensionality reduction is an unsupervised learning technique that reduces the number of features in a dataset. It’s often used to preprocess data for other machine learning functions and reduce complexity and overheads. For example, it may blur out or crop background features in an image recognition application.

SageMaker Model evaluation
Model Evaluation - Model evaluation refers to assessing the performance of a machine learning model using specific metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. Model evaluation does not involve exploratory tasks like calculating statistics or visualizing data; instead, it focuses on validating the effectiveness of a trained model. Therefore, this phase does not align with the company's current activities.
Model evaluation is the process of evaluating and comparing model outputs to determine the model that is best suited for a use case.


Diffusion Model - Diffusion models create new data by iteratively making controlled random changes to an initial data sample. They start with the original data and add subtle changes (noise), progressively making it less similar to the original. This noise is carefully controlled to ensure the generated data remains coherent and realistic. After adding noise over several iterations, the diffusion model reverses the process. Reverse denoising gradually removes the noise to produce a new data sample that resembles the original.

Generative adversarial network (GAN) - GANs work by training two neural networks in a competitive manner. The first network, known as the generator, generates fake data samples by adding random noise. The second network, called the discriminator, tries to distinguish between real data and the fake data produced by the generator. During training, the generator continually improves its ability to create realistic data while the discriminator becomes better at telling real from fake. This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data that is so convincing that the discriminator can't differentiate it from real data.

Variational autoencoders (VAE) - VAEs use two neural networks—the encoder and the decoder. The encoder neural network maps the input data to a mean and variance for each dimension of the latent space. It generates a random sample from a Gaussian (normal) distribution. This sample is a point in the latent space and represents a compressed, simplified version of the input data. The decoder neural network takes this sampled point from the latent space and reconstructs it back into data that resembles the original input.


Interpretability is about understanding the internal mechanisms of a machine learning model, whereas explainability focuses on providing understandable reasons for the model's predictions and behaviors to stakeholders

Interpretability:
Interpretability refers to how easily a human can understand the reasoning behind a model's predictions or decisions. It's about making the inner workings of a machine learning model transparent and comprehensible.

Explainability:
Explainability goes a step further by providing insights into why a model made a specific prediction, especially when the model itself is complex and not inherently interpretable. It involves using methods and tools to make the predictions of complex models understandable to humans.




Confusion matrix
Confusion matrix is a tool specifically designed to evaluate the performance of classification models by displaying the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance across all classes, making it the most suitable choice for evaluating a classification model's accuracy and identifying potential areas for improvement. It provides a comprehensive overview of the model's performance by detailing how many instances were correctly or incorrectly classified in each category. This enables the company to understand where the model is performing well and where it may need adjustments, such as improving the classification of specific material types.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a metric commonly used to measure the average error in regression models by calculating the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. However, RMSE is not suitable for classification tasks, as it is designed to measure continuous outcomes, not discrete class predictions.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions without considering their direction. MAE is typically used in regression tasks to quantify the accuracy of a continuous variable's predictions, not for classification tasks where the outputs are categorical rather than continuous.

Correlation matrix - Correlation matrix measures the statistical correlation between different variables or features in a dataset, typically used to understand the relationships between continuous variables. A correlation matrix is not designed to evaluate the performance of a classification model, as it does not provide any insight into the accuracy or errors of categorical predictions.







Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The company is in the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, which involves examining the data through statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and form hypotheses. This phase is crucial for understanding the dataset’s structure and characteristics, making it the most appropriate description of the current activities. Tasks like calculating statistics and visualizing data are fundamental to EDA, helping to uncover patterns, detect outliers, and gain insights into the data before any modeling is done. EDA serves as the foundation for building predictive models by providing a deep understanding of the data.

Data Preparation - This option is incorrect because data preparation involves cleaning and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for analysis or modeling. This may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, or transforming variables, but it does not typically involve calculating statistics and visualizing data. While data preparation is an important step, it does not encompass the exploratory analysis activities described in the question.

Data Augmentation - Data augmentation is a technique used primarily in machine learning to artificially increase the size and variability of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the existing data, such as flipping images or adding noise. It is not related to the tasks of calculating statistics or visualizing data, which are part of EDA.

Amazon DeepRacer
Amazon DeepRacer - AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to test RL models by racing on a physical track. Using cameras to view the track and a reinforcement model to control throttle and steering, the car shows how a model trained in a simulated environment can be transferred to the real world.






Sampling bias
This is the correct answer because sampling bias occurs when the data used to train the model does not accurately reflect the diversity of the real-world population. If certain ethnic groups are underrepresented or overrepresented in the training data, the model may learn biased patterns, causing it to flag individuals from those groups more frequently. In this scenario, sampling bias leads to discriminatory outcomes and unfairly targets specific groups based on ethnicity.

Incorrect options:

Measurement bias - Measurement bias is not the correct explanation because it involves inaccuracies in data collection, such as faulty equipment or inconsistent measurement processes. This type of bias does not inherently affect the demographic composition of the dataset and, therefore, is not directly responsible for bias based on ethnicity in the model's outputs.

Observer bias - Observer bias is irrelevant in this context because it relates to human errors or subjectivity during data analysis or observation. Since the AI model processes the data autonomously without human intervention, observer bias is not a factor in the biased outcomes of the model.

Confirmation bias - Confirmation bias involves selectively searching for or interpreting information to confirm existing beliefs. This type of bias does not apply to the AI system in this scenario, as there is no indication that the model is designed to reinforce any preconceptions or assumptions related to ethnicity.



Bias: error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the model, leading to underfitting
Variance: error due to the model being too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, leading to overfitting
The bias versus variance trade-off in machine learning is about finding a balance between bias (error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the model, leading to underfitting) and variance (error due to the model being too sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, leading to overfitting). The goal is to achieve a model that generalizes well to new data.







Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)

Embedding models are algorithms trained to encapsulate information into dense representations in a multi-dimensional space. Data scientists use embedding models to enable ML models to comprehend and reason with high-dimensional data.

BERT is the correct answer because it is specifically designed to capture the contextual meaning of words by looking at both the words that come before and after them (bidirectional context). Unlike older models that use static embeddings, BERT creates dynamic word embeddings that change depending on the surrounding text, allowing it to understand the different meanings of the same word in various contexts. This makes BERT ideal for tasks that require understanding the nuances and subtleties of language.


Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - PCA is a statistical method used for reducing the dimensions of large datasets to simplify them while retaining most of the variance in the data. While it can be applied to various fields, including image compression and data visualization, PCA does not understand or differentiate the contextual meanings of words in natural language processing. Thus, it is not a suitable choice for understanding word meanings in different phrases.

Word2Vec - Word2Vec is an early embedding model that creates vector representations of words based on their co-occurrence in a given text. However, it uses static embeddings, meaning each word has a single vector representation regardless of the context. This limitation makes Word2Vec less effective at differentiating words with multiple meanings across different phrases since it cannot adjust the embedding based on context, unlike BERT.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) - SVD is a matrix decomposition method used in various applications like data compression and noise reduction. Although it can be part of older methods for text analysis, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), it is not designed to handle the dynamic, context-dependent meanings of words in sentences. Therefore, it is not suitable for differentiating contextual meanings of words across various phrases.

You can quickly spin up resources as you need them – from infrastructure services, such as compute, storage, and databases, to the Internet of Things, machine learning, data lakes and analytics, and much more.

Elasticity
Elasticity - With cloud computing elasticity, you don’t have to over-provision resources upfront to handle peak levels of business activity in the future. Instead, you provision the number of resources that you need. You can scale these resources up or down instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.

Cost savings
Cost savings - The cloud allows you to trade capital expenses (such as data centers and physical servers) for variable expenses, and only pay for IT as you consume it. Plus, the variable expenses are much lower than what you would pay to do it yourself because of the economies of scale.

Ability to deploy globally in minutes
Ability to deploy globally in minutes - With the cloud, you can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. For example, AWS has infrastructure all over the world, so you can deploy your application in multiple physical locations with just a few clicks.
