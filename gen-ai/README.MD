# Generative AI (Gen-AI)

## What is Generative AI?
- **Generative AI (Gen-AI)** is a type of artificial intelligence focused on **creating new content** — like text, images, music, code, or videos — by learning patterns from the data it was trained on.
- It doesn’t just recognize existing data; it **generates something new** that mimics what it has learned.

## Examples of Generative AI tasks:
- **Text:** Writing stories, answering questions, translating languages.
- **Images:** Creating realistic pictures or artwork.
- **Audio:** Composing music or generating speech.
- **Code:** Writing or debugging programming code.
- **Video:** Producing or editing videos.

# Foundation Models

## What are Foundation Models?
- **Foundation Models** are large AI models trained on massive, diverse datasets — including text, images, and audio.
- These models act as a **base** or **starting point** for more specific AI applications.
- Training Foundation Models is costly and requires powerful computing resources — often costing **millions of dollars**.

## Companies developing Foundation Models:
- **OpenAI** (GPT-4, DALL·E)
- **Google** (Gemini, BERT)
- **Meta (Facebook)** (LLaMA)
- **Amazon** (Titan)
- **Anthropic** (Claude)

## Open-source vs. Commercial models:
- **Open-source models:** Free to use and modify (e.g., Meta's LLaMA, Google's BERT).
- **Commercial models:** Require a license or subscription (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4, Anthropic's Claude).

# Large Language Models (LLMs)

## What are LLMs?
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are a specific type of **Foundation Model** focused entirely on understanding and generating text.
- They are trained on massive amounts of text data — books, articles, websites — and learn the relationships between words to produce human-like text.

## Key features of LLMs:
- **Massive scale:** Trained on billions of parameters (the "knobs" AI adjusts to learn).
- **Language tasks:** Can handle a wide range of language-related activities, including:
  - **Translation** (converting text from one language to another)
  - **Summarization** (condensing long content)
  - **Question answering**
  - **Content creation**

## How do LLMs generate text?
1. **Prompt:** The user gives an input (like a question or a sentence).
2. **Prediction:** The model predicts the most likely next word based on learned patterns.
3. **Selection:** It picks a word — not always the most obvious one — to create natural-sounding text.

### Example:
**Prompt:** "After the rain, the streets were..."

The LLM might consider several options:
- **wet** (40% probability)
- **flooded** (25%)
- **slippery** (15%)
- **empty** (10%)

It chooses one word randomly but weighted by these probabilities — making the output feel creative and varied.

# Foundation Models vs. LLMs: What’s the Difference?

| **Foundation Models**          | **LLMs (Large Language Models)**     |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Broad AI models trained on diverse data (text, images, audio, etc.). | A type of Foundation Model focused on text and language tasks. |
| Can generate text, images, audio, video, or code.                   | Specializes in text generation and understanding.              |
| Examples: GPT-4, DALL·E, Gemini.                                   | Examples: GPT-4, BERT, LLaMA.                                 |
| Used to build AI tools for many domains.                            | Used for chatbots, translators, and content creators.          |

In short:
- **All LLMs are Foundation Models** because they’re built on large datasets.
- **Not all Foundation Models are LLMs** — some create images (DALL·E) or audio (Whisper) instead of text.
