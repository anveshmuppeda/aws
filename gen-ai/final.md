# Cloud 
Example of Cloud Computing Types
• Infrastructure as a Service:
    • Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
• Platform as a Service:
    • Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)    
• Software as a Service:
    • Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)


AWS Availability Zones
• Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6)
Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity




GenAI Concepts – Tokenization
• Tokenization: converting raw text into a sequence of tokens
• Word-based tokenization: text is split into individual words
• Subword tokenization: some words can be split too (helpful for long words…)


Top P represents the percentage of most likely candidates that the model considers for the next token. Choose a lower value to decrease the size of the pool and limit the options to more likely outputs. Choose a higher value to increase the size of the pool and allow the model to consider less likely outputs
