# Cloud 
Example of Cloud Computing Types
• Infrastructure as a Service:
    • Amazon EC2 (on AWS)
• Platform as a Service:
    • Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS)    
• Software as a Service:
    • Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning)


AWS Availability Zones
• Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6)
Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity




GenAI Concepts – Tokenization
• Tokenization: converting raw text into a sequence of tokens
• Word-based tokenization: text is split into individual words
• Subword tokenization: some words can be split too (helpful for long words…)
