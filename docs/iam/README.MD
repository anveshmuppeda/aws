# IAM  

## 1. Introduction
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is at the heart of AWS security. It allows you to manage who can access your resources and what actions they can perform. In this guide, we‚Äôll walk through the hands-on process of configuring every aspect of IAM. We recommend setting up a test AWS account (or using your free tier) and practicing these examples in a safe environment.

## 2. Understanding IAM Concepts
What is IAM?
IAM is a service that helps you control access to AWS resources. It allows you to create and manage AWS users, groups, roles, and policies. With IAM, you can assign permissions that dictate what actions users and services can perform.
Key Components
Users: Individual identities with long-term credentials.
Groups: Collections of users that share common permissions.
Roles: Identities with specific permissions that are assumed by trusted entities (users, applications, or services).
Policies: JSON documents that define permissions. These can be managed (AWS provided) or customer-managed (custom).
For more detailed definitions, refer to the AWS IAM Documentation.
